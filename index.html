        Hello, my name is Parker Taumua and I am currently a senior at Aiea High School. I am 18 years old and still livng with my parents. Hobbies I like to do is spend time with family and friends, sleep, and playing football. In the near future, I'd like to be a sportswriter or photographer. Sports have created tight bonds and relationships with many people throughout my life. If I do make it, I would to like to stay in this field for a long time and meet new people. In order to achieve this goal, I need to stay in school and learn something new everyday. School can play a big part in everybody's life. When I first started off high school, I never really took it serious until now I matured and relized school can take you far in life.
